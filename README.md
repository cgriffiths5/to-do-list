#To do list

This is my first project using React. I hope that this is the start of many React projects. I was motivated to try and build an app using Javascript and the React framework. 

I wanted to create a basic Javascript project but adding features to take it to a higher level. 

In addition to this I wanted to then learn how to use Git and Github to learn how to utilize source control. 

#Installation
